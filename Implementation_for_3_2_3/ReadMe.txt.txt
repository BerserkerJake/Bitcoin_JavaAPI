The implementation for 3.2.3 is stored in this folder.

I copied and pasted from my UserCluster.java. It's basically applied in that file as well.

This is for the sake of simplicity to run code.

See the FBI address and potential addresses of silk road by running:
	./compile.sh
	./run_cluster.sh

The result should be list as follows:

FBI Address: [1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH]
Potential silk road address: 19uruykinejqWxnMsusvw4Ftkq4rxJEHjK 1B3jqFtGZmM7iS44EZasFBTtDDXzR2WFe5 142BWQJaU2qQ7M8F7xL9ogP1j3FhKqbLWY

I added uc.analyzeUserGraph() in UserCluster.java to show the result in the console.
